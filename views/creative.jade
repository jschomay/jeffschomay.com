    **Screenwriting.  Game design.  Visual Design.  UX.  Gamification.  Photography.  Creating with the intent to engage, inspire, & intrigue.**

    I've always been intrinsically creative.  I use creativity to stand out.  I use creativity to solve problems.  I use creativity to make things more fun and more interesting.

    Although creativity plays an important role in all of my endeavors, my main professional creative pursuit is screenwriting.  I have been studying and practicing the craft of screenwriting for many years.  I've developed a strong insight for creating stories that resonate and entertain, and a deep familiarity with the craft of building screenplays that fully engage the audience.

    I have also recently taken a serious passion in the field of game development -- an arena where I play on both sides of the creative/technical fence.  Creating a game that offers fun playability and a unique attraction is a challenge that requires tremendous creativity, knowledge of the field, and understanding of human psychology, but it is very rewarding.
    
    One interesting aspect of having such a wide a range of interests, is that many of my disciplines overlap.  This leads to unique situations to creativly use elements from one discipline in another.  Another benefit is that I often have a unique perspective, and can pull back to  see the "big picture" from a different angle.

    **I find my creativity comes in four main ways:**

  :markdown

    * _Inspiration_.  Experiencing other creative works, and constantly learning. I read a lot.  The library is my friend.  Often one sentence will spark an idea that has been hanging around beneath the surface for a while.  Other times I'll get a glimpse of a new perspective and the inspiration hits all at once.

    * _Travel_.  Getting out, moving, and being in nature always loosens up my mind.  But actual traveling to new and interesting places always seems to fill my mind with all kinds of ideas that I can't wait to play with when I get back home.

    * _Dreaming_.  Sometimes this means actual dreaming, but mostly it's day-dreaming.  I spend a lot of time "staring into space."  But inside, my mind is rapidly exploring complex worlds of branching possibilities.  Something creative always falls out.  The trick is keeping track of all the thoughts, and coercing them into something meaningful and worthwhile.  This is where craft and flexibility comes in.

    * _Intent_.  A lot of the time I just have to make myself be creative.  I identify a problem that I need a creative solution to, and I just start attacking it from different angles, playing games of "what if," and let my mind follow each thread to see where it goes.  Acknowledging  that there is a creative solution out there makes it easier to work towards finding it.
