            <h2>My Creative Side</h2><p><strong>Screenwriting.  Digital and tabletop game design.  Visual Design.  Photography.</strong></p>

<p>I didn&#39;t start out as a programmer, and in fact my degree is in Film Production.  I&#39;ve always been intrinsically creative.  I use creativity to stand out.  I use creativity to solve problems.  But mostly I use creativity to make things more fun and more interesting.</p>

<p>My creative focus has shifted numerous times over the  years, from fine arts to computer graphics to film production to screenwriting to video game design to tabletop game design.  I've been particularly interested in combining the storytelling from my film background with the interactive experience in games.</p>

<p>One interesting aspect of having such a wide a range of interests, is that many of my disciplines overlap.  This leads to unique situations to creatively use elements from one discipline in another.  Another benefit is that I often have a unique perspective, and can pull back to  see the &quot;big picture&quot; from a different angle.</p>

            <h2>My Technical Side</h2><p><strong>Full-stack web application development.  Polyglot.  Functional programming.  Game dev.</strong></p>

<p>I love coding.  I spend most of my time writing code, or talking about code, or thinking about code.  With my code before me in vim, I have the power to create anything, literally at my fingertips.</p>

<p>I wasn&#39;t always a programmer.  Although I played with coding ever since I learned to make simple games on my TRS-80 in BASIC, my original focus was more visual, and I earned a BFA degree in Film Production rather than CS.  Since then however, I have dove deep, and continue to diligently hone my skills and stay active in the community.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve gathered a wide array of experience, both professionally and in my side-projects.  These experiences have led me to appreciate functional programming, a topic which I am particularly passionate about.  I have spoken at conferences, contributed to and created open source libraries, written articles, and made videos and tutorials around the web.</p>
