            <h2>My Creative Side</h2><p><strong>Screenwriting.  Game design.  Visual Design.  UX.  Gamification.  Photography.  Creating with the intent to engage, inspire, &amp; make an impact.</strong></p>

<p>I&#39;ve always been intrinsically creative.  I use creativity to stand out.  I use creativity to solve problems.  I use creativity to make things more fun and more interesting. </p><img src="images/screenwriting.jpg" width="140" class="float-left"><p>My original way to creatively express myself was primary visual, in a number of mediums, from hand-drawn artwork, to digital art, to photography and cinematics.  </p>

<p>After earning my degree in Film Production, I became more and more focused on storytelling, and focused my creative expression on screenwriting.</p>

<p>Recently, I have shifted my focus again, and now apply my creative attention to game design, and the overlap of screenwriting and story in games.</p>

<p>One interesting aspect of having such a wide a range of interests, is that many of my disciplines overlap.  This leads to unique situations to creatively use elements from one discipline in another.  Another benefit is that I often have a unique perspective, and can pull back to  see the &quot;big picture&quot; from a different angle.</p>

<p><strong>I find my creativity comes in four main ways:</strong></p><img src="images/czech-picture.jpg" width="120" class="float-right"><ul><li><p><em>Inspiration</em>.  Experiencing other creative works, and constantly learning. I read a lot.  The library is my friend.  Often one sentence will spark an idea that has been hanging around beneath the surface for a while.  Other times I&#39;ll get a glimpse of a new perspective and the inspiration hits all at once.</p></li><li><p><em>Travel</em>.  Getting out, moving, and being in nature always loosens up my mind.  But actual traveling to new and interesting places always seems to fill my mind with all kinds of ideas that I can&#39;t wait to play with when I get back home.</p></li><li><p><em>Dreaming</em>.  Sometimes this means actual dreaming, but mostly it&#39;s day-dreaming.  I spend a lot of time &quot;staring into space.&quot;  But inside, my mind is rapidly exploring complex worlds of branching possibilities.  Something creative always falls out.  The trick is keeping track of all the thoughts, and coercing them into something meaningful and worthwhile.  This is where craft and flexibility comes in.</p></li><li><p><em>Intent</em>.  A lot of the time I just have to make myself be creative.  I identify a problem that I need a creative solution to, and I just start attacking it from different angles, playing games of &quot;what if,&quot; and let my mind follow each thread to see where it goes.  Acknowledging  that there is a creative solution out there makes it easier to work towards finding it.</p></li></ul>

            <h2>My Technical Side</h2><p><strong>JavaScript.  CoffeeScript.  Node.  HTML5.  Mobile.  Apps.  Games.</strong></p>

<p>I love coding.</p>

<ul><li>It offers the challenge of solving complex logic puzzles.</li><li>It imposes order and structure onto chaos.</li><li>It bestows the power of creation - to literally manifest ideas into reality.</li></ul>

<p>Notable transitions in my coding journey:</p>

<ul><li><p><strong>From visual to code</strong>: Though I played with coding ever since I learned to make simple games on my TRS-80 in BASIC, my primary focus throughout school was visual.  I&#39;ve worked as a cinematographer, a film editor, a graphic artist, and a 3D modeler.  As I got more involved with web technologies, I glimpsed the &quot;dev culture&quot; and the elegance of robustly written code.  The point when I noticed I preferred to work in an editor instead of Photoshop and talk about async control flow is when I realized I was a &quot;true&quot; developer.</p></li><li><p><strong>The backbone.js revolution</strong>: I was swept up with the rest of the world at the entrance of the SPA and moving to MVC in the browser.  After that it was all about trying to keep up with the never ending js lib explosion, but always relying on the stability of keeping your data separated from your views and definitely not in the DOM!</p></li><li><p><strong>Node.js</strong>:  I got involved early with node and I haven&#39;t looked back.  For a while I was one of the &quot;cool&quot; developers - &quot;Wow, those guys are working with node!&quot;  Node brought with it a very interesting and very relevant ecosystem, including async utils, npm, and build tools like browserify - even more js libs to keep track of.</p></li><li><p><strong>Game dev</strong>: I was very lucky to work with an amazing game designer who inspired me with the magic of captivating a player with well designed mechanics and pacing.  Coding and games have often overlapped for me, but this turning point gave me a strong push into the world of game dev.  It is a perfect fit between my technical and creative sides.</p></li><li><p><strong>From imperative to functional</strong>: Underscore.js brought a revelation to many developers I believe, myself included.  I felt a definite shift in my dev powers when I started using map and reduce.  I&#39;ve recently taken this way further with the outstanding &quot;auto-curried&quot; ramda.js library, which I found early on.  It has has since been indoctrinated as a cornerstone of our development tools where I work.  The biggest win of FP for me is that is describes <em>what</em> your code does, not <em>how</em> it does it.</p></li><li><p><strong>Vim</strong>: I finally got on vim, my transformation is complete.  Coding never felt the same (or so good).  I am one with the code.  I am free of the mouse.  I could talk for hours about neat vim tricks and optimal navigation combos.  True geek-status confirmed.</p></li><li><p><strong>The challenge of scalability</strong>:  The world seems to be experiencing a new revolution where backbone.js-style apps aren&#39;t cutting it in terms of scalability.  I ran into this problem directly at my work when tasked with re-architecthing the platform base for our V2.0.  Scalability heavily informed our design decisions, and we became early adopters of Facebook&#39;s react.js library and &quot;flux&quot; pattern, which so far has been a very enjoyable experience that many other leading companies seem to be moving towards as well.  The new paradigm for developer sanity is building composable modules while maintaining consistent state through immutable data structures and uni-directional flows.</p></li><li><p><strong>Into the future</strong>: What&#39;s next for me?  I&#39;m currently looking into the &quot;haskell-esque&quot; FRP language &quot;elm&quot; to expand my horizons into new ways of writing and thinking about code.</p></li></ul>
