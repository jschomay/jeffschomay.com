            <h2>My Creative Side</h2><p><strong>Screenwriting.  Game design.  Visual Design.  UX.</strong></p>

<p>I didn&#39;t start out as a programmer, and in fact my degree is in Film Production.  I&#39;ve always been intrinsically creative.  I use creativity to stand out.  I use creativity to solve problems.  But mostly I use creativity to make things more fun and more interesting.</p><img src="http://photography.jeffschomay.com/ArtWork/images/romangarden.jpg" width="140" class="float-left"><p>My original way to creatively express myself was primary visual, in a number of mediums, including <a href="http://photography.jeffschomay.com/ArtWork/twodimensional.htm">hand-drawn and digital artwork</a>, <a href="http://photography.jeffschomay.com/ArtWork/mywork.htm">3D graphics</a>, and photography.</p>

<p>After earning my degree in Film Production, I became more and more focused on storytelling, and focused my creative expression on screenwriting.</p>

<p>Recently, I have shifted my focus again, and now apply my creative attention to game design, and the overlap of screenwriting and story in games.</p>

<p>One interesting aspect of having such a wide a range of interests, is that many of my disciplines overlap.  This leads to unique situations to creatively use elements from one discipline in another.  Another benefit is that I often have a unique perspective, and can pull back to  see the &quot;big picture&quot; from a different angle.</p>

            <h2>My Technical Side</h2><p><strong>Full-stack web application development.  Polyglot.  Functional programming.  Game dev.</strong></p>

<p>I love coding.  I spend most of my time writing code, or talking about code, or thinking about code.  With my code before me in vim, I have the power to create anything, literally at my fingertips.</p>

<p>I wasn&#39;t always a programmer.  Although I played with coding ever since I learned to make simple games on my TRS-80 in BASIC, my original focus was more visual, and I earned a BFA degree in Film Production rather than CS.  Since then however, I have dove deep, and continue to diligently hone my skills and stay active in the community.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve gathered a wide array of experience, both professionally and in my side-projects.  These experiences have led me to appreciate functional programming, a topic which I am particularly passionate about.  I have spoken at conferences, written articles, and made videos and tutorials around the web.</p>
